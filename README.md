# Student-Management-System

Same old record keeping system is existed till now in most of the school areas.No development has been made through the use of computer
system. All the records are managed using huge paper made registers, note-copies and hard-covers. So, its not a kind of proper data 
management, we can say. It's totally unsafe as well as uncivilized way of filing and indexing system. Only the advanced and private 
colleges or schools of urban areas uses computer applications to handle records existing on them. But no effort has been made in the 
government schools in order to establish new computerized and digital way of file keeping system. Due to these reasons, the education 
system in the country is undeveloped. Many unwanted environmental factors like fire, heavy rain etc damages the handwritten files totally. 
Not only natural disasters but also the theft and robbery are also equally affecting loss of data, important records and files. So, it’s a 
totally mess. So, in the present context, no any well-satisfied and secure system has been made so that they can meet all the user’s 
requirements. There are many schools and student managementsystems developed, but they are too costly, advanced and difficult to use by the 
normal users because of very sophisticated technologies used. So, there is no any software made which is 100% fit for the school to manage 
the student’s basic information and certain medium level of security.

<b>Proposed System and Objectives</b>

<b>Student Management System</b> is a simple application, which is especially generated and designed for the school levels in order to 
enter the student’s basic record and information and can perform other functions like addition, deletion and modification if required. It 
is username and password protected as well. So, a school need a normal computer application like this where it has ability to do all those 
task like other programs do.

Following are the major objectives behind the new proposed system:
  
-It creates user friendly environment, where a normal user can easily access through all the benefits of the system. 

-It provides security from unauthorized access, only admin or authorized users are access-granted to the system.

-It increases efficiency and saves the time. No any danger and obstacles from external entities.

-Easy access of saved data inside the system
